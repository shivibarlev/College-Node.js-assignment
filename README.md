# College-Node.js-assignment

## Description
In this assignment I created a website that implements a login system and a weather site. <br>
After logging in, you get access to a weather page where you can add locations and get the weather data for each location. <br>
Each user that loggs in has a session and should have his locations saved using the sqlite DB.

## Known issues:
There isn't much error handling when doing the API requests because of time constraints. <br>
Should be greeted with your user name when logging in, for some reason not working.

## Run instruction:
Open in editor and run npm install, after that run node app.js (Of course install Node.js) <br>
On your browser go to localhost:3000
